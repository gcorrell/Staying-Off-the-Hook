        <h2 id="Consequences">Consequences</h2>
        <p>The impact that phishing attacks can have on their victims can vary based on the attack, 
        but even the most innocuous-seeming phishing attempts should be taken seriously and 
        handled with caution. This section will discuss the different types of tolls that phishing 
        can take on its victims.</p>

        <h3 id="Financial Losses">Financial Losses</h3>

        <p>Perhaps the most common aim of a phishing attack is to take some amount of money from a target. 
        The specific amount that the attack plans to make can vary from relatively small amounts to 
        millions of dollars, as is demonstrated by the cases provided in the real-world examples section. </p>

        <h3 id="Financial Losses">Financial Losses</h3>

        <p>Due to the fact that phishing scams tend to target personal information including (but not 
        limited to) a person’s website credentials, finance details, or even social security number, it is 
        unsurprising that the consequences of more serious phishing attacks can surpass small financial 
        losses and enter the realm of identity theft, something that can take a victim months or even 
        years to overcome. Although identity theft does tend to involve financial losses, there is an 
        important distinction between phishing attacks that aim to get a particular sum of money from a 
        target and those that aim to steal an identity. In some cases, phishing attacks may simply try to 
        trick a target into sending money to an illegitimate site or bank account, which would not qualify 
        as identity theft. Identity theft occurs when an attack targets information about a target that can 
        then be used to gain access to the target’s financial accounts.</p>

        <h3 id="Non-financial and Personal Consequences">Non-financial and Personal Consequences</h3>

        <p>One aspect of phishing that is often overlooked is the emotional and psychological effect that it 
        can have on its victims. In a study by North Carolina State University that reviewed both victims’ 
        and non-victims’ beliefs about phishing attacks, there was a common sentiment among participants who 
        had been victims of phishing attacks that a sense of embarrassment, loss of self-confidence, and 
        loss of trust in particular mediums were incurred after they were victimized. In fact, these 
        assertions made up 34% of the write-in qualitative comments that were made in an “other consequences 
        of phishing” section of the survey. For example, one comment indicated that “Craigslist has lots of 
        jobs but I am afraid to respond to their ads because a scammer can pretend to be an employer. The 
        scammer's ads look just like real ones”.</p>

        <h2 id="Real World Examples">Real World Examples</h2>

        <p>To illustrate some of the real-world impacts that phishing attacks have had, this subsection will 
        detail a few particularly costly instances of successful phishing attacks.</p>

        <h3 id="Google and Facebook">Google and Facebook</h3>

        <p>One of the largest examples of a successful corporate phishing attack occurred between 2013 and 2015 
        when Evaldas Rimasauskas incorporated a company with the intention of impersonating Quanta Computer, 
        a legitimate Taiwan-based tech company that regularly does business with tech giants. Rimasauskas and 
        his co-conspirators created fake email accounts to send forged emails and fake invoices to employees 
        of Facebook and Google. Convinced that the invoices were from the real Quanta Computer, the targeted 
        employees sent a total of $100 million to fake bank accounts over a period of more than a year, 
        making this one of the most financially lucrative phishing scams of all time. Rimasauskas was 
        apprehended by Lithuanian authorities in 2017, and he eventually forfeited $49.7 million of the 
        earnings from the scheme. Nonetheless, the historic magnitude of the initial financial losses for 
        the affected companies allows this story to serve as a stark reminder of the dangers that corporate 
        phishing can pose.</p>

        <h3 id="The Hall Family">The Hall Family</h3>

        <p>A more personal (and far more common) example of a successful phishing attack was demonstrated 
        against the (unnamed) father of Lee Hall in 2023. Hall’s father received a phone call from an 
        individual who sounded like his grandson, Christian Hall. The caller expressed a tone of urgency and 
        told the grandfather that he had been on a vacation in Mexico and got into trouble after having too 
        much to drink. They then asked for a sum of money to help them to get out of whatever dangerous 
        situation that they were claiming to be in. Pushed to take action, the grandfather sent $1,000 to 
        the caller. Upon further investigation, Lee Hall found that Christian was in Dallas attending 
        college as he was expected to be, and had never been in Mexico. The attacker who had called Lee’s 
        father allegedly used an AI-generated deep fake voice to impersonate Christian to try to manipulate 
        him into sending money, which he ultimately did. This type of phishing attack is far more convincing 
        (and thus more dangerous) in a modern context than traditional phishing emails or phone calls, and 
        has continued to become more common over the past several years. Although Lee Hall’s grandfather 
        only lost $1,000 to the scam, many more ambitious versions of the attack may request even greater 
        sums, leading to greater financial losses for their victims.</p>

        <h3 id="Pat's Granola">Pat's Granola</h3>

        <p>Small businesses are also common targets for phishing attacks, and can be far more devastating for 
        them than attacks on large corporations that can recoup their lost funds more easily. An example of 
        this occurred in 2023 when Pat Bennett, a small business owner who had been selling granola in the 
        Cleveland area through her business Instagram page called Pat’s Granola, was caught off-guard by a 
        convincing phishing attack. Bennett received a message on Instagram from another small business 
        owner who she knew personally asking her to vote for the sender in an online contest, with the 
        message including a link to the voting page. After clicking the link, Bennett unexpectedly lost 
        access to her Instagram and Facebook accounts through which she was conducting business. She was 
        able to ascertain help in trying to find the attacker, but didn’t get any farther than tracking an 
        IP address to Europe. Bennett later received a letter offering to return access to her accounts for 
        the price of $10,000. She decided not to pay the ransom, having to restart the social media 
        components of her business from scratch, undoubtedly taking a significant hit to her sales. As 
        phishing scams continue to adapt to the prominence of social media, it has become increasingly 
        important to be wary of suspicious direct messages on those platforms, especially those with 
        unidentified links.</p>
