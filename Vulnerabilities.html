        <p>The types of vulnerabilities that an attack can exploit can generally be divided into two primary categories: 
        system vulnerabilities and human vulnerabilities. System vulnerabilities refers to technical aspects or flaws of 
        the system that the attacker is attempting to compromise that can be manipulated in order to perform an attack. 
        Human vulnerabilities are the ways in which people can be deceived or manipulated into revealing their own private 
        information. Phishing attacks generally take advantage of human vulnerabilities as opposed to system vulnerabilities, 
        though both can play a part in how a phishing attack is executed. The following section will discuss specifics of 
        the vulnerabilities that make phishing attacks possible, as well as the approaches that attackers use to manipulate 
        them. </p>
