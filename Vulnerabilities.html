        <p>The types of vulnerabilities that an attack can exploit can generally be divided into two primary categories: 
        system vulnerabilities and human vulnerabilities. System vulnerabilities refers to technical aspects or flaws of 
        the system that the attacker is attempting to compromise that can be manipulated in order to perform an attack. 
        Human vulnerabilities are the ways in which people can be deceived or manipulated into revealing their own private 
        information. Phishing attacks generally take advantage of human vulnerabilities as opposed to system vulnerabilities, 
        though both can play a part in how a phishing attack is executed. The following section will discuss specifics of 
        the vulnerabilities that make phishing attacks possible, as well as the approaches that attackers use to manipulate 
        them. </p>

        <h2 id="Human Vulnerabilities">Human Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <h3 id="Lack of Technical Knowledge or Awareness">Lack of Technical Knowledge or Awareness</h3>
        <p>A great number of phishing attacks depend entirely on the victim lacking knowledge about how computers or the 
        internet work. For instance, an attacker may send a potential victim an email claiming to be from Microsoft notifying 
        them that their machine has a virus, and requests payment in order to fix the issue. Though many people in the modern 
        day recognize that this is not a way that Microsoft or any other legitimate software or hardware provider would contact 
        you about such an issue, those who have less experience with technology may not find the distinctions between what is 
        real and what is fraudulent to be obvious, and may become a victim of the attack. </p>

        <h3 id="Trust and Care for Friends and Family Members">Trust and Care for Friends and Family Members</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, a phishing attack may attempt to make use of a potential victim’s care for their friends or family members 
        to encourage them to interact with a fraudulent email or other message. For instance, an attacker might compose a fraudulent 
        email claiming or appearing to be from the potential victim’s nephew, cousin, or other extended family member, asking for 
        money for some kind of urgent purpose, such as paying bail. These attacks are predicated on the notion that someone will be 
        much more receptive to requests for money or information if they think that they are talking to someone they know. </p>

        <h2 id="Technical Vulnerabilities">Technical Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <h3 id="Lack of Input Validation on Websites">Lack of Input Validation on Websites</h3>
        <p>This vulnerability is particularly relevant to attacks that use the medium of the Internet. Phishing attackers can use a 
        website’s lack of <a href="Terms.html#InputValidation">security indicators</a> to inject malicious code into an existing website in order to try to gather a target’s login 
        credentials or other information. Essentially, a poorly constructed site may fail to disallow users to inject their own <a href="Terms.html#Client-side">client-side</a> 
        scripts to the site, resulting in its contents being changed in order to cause a target user to unknowingly deliver information to 
        the attacker rather than the legitimate site runners. For example, by injecting a client-side script into a legitimate website, an 
        attacker could add a login form to the site that asks for users’ credentials and delivers them to a malicious website rather than to 
        the legitimate one. This is known as a cross-site scripting attack, a type of attack that has a variety of uses both within and beyond 
        the scope of phishing. As an example, an attacker seeking to use this type of approach might enter something like the following line into a form field on a login 
        page where a user would normally enter a password. </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="Images/NewHTMLInjectionExample.PNG" 
                width="500" 
                height="400"
                alt="HTML Injection Example">
        </div>
        
        <p>This line, when used as input on an HTML-based site, may be interpreted as a line of the page's source HTML. If so, the line would 
        create a button on the page that would appear to be a login button, but would actually link to a malicious website. Proper use of input 
        validation would prevent a user from including special characters in their input, making this line impossible to submit.</p>

        <h3 id="Browser/Browser Extension Vulnerabilities">Browser/Browser Extension Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>There are a few ways in which attackers can use client-side programming languages like JavaScript to exploit vulnerabilities in a 
        user’s web browser and its extensions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In some cases, attackers may be capable of injecting a target’s machine with <a href="Terms.html#Malware">malware</a> that can be used to complete the 
        execution of the phishing attack simply by having them visit a malicious website or view a malicious email that manipulates 
        the user’s web browser. The attacker can use JavaScript code embedded in a malicious website/email to cause a user’s browser 
        to automatically download malware onto the user's device when the site or email is viewed. This is known as a drive-by download. 
        The functionality of the downloaded malware can depend on the type of attack that the attacker is attempting to perform, but 
        malware meant to help execute phishing attacks can do things like redirect legitimate web addresses to malicious ones or 
        directly record information using tools such as keystroke loggers, which record the keys pressed on the user’s keyboard, 
        revealing their credentials for any site they log into.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Attackers can also use JavaScript code to manipulate how a user’s browser displays the information about a webpage. 
        A common version of this type of attack spoofs part of the <a href="Terms.html#ChromeArea">chrome area</a> of a user’s browser window (the chrome area of a 
        browser window appears at the top of the window, and includes the address bar, status bar, toolbar, and menu area above 
        the content area) in order to make the URL for a malicious website look legitimate. Part of this process can even include 
        making <a href="Terms.html#SecurityIndicators">security indicators</a> such as the SSL lock and https portion of the URL appear to be present even when they shouldn’t 
        be. Much like the JavaScript code that allows for the possibility of a drive-by download, the code that changes the appearance 
        of the chrome area is automatically executed when a user visits the malicious web page.  </p>
