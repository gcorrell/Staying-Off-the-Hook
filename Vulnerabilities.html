        <p>The types of vulnerabilities that an attack can exploit can generally be divided into two primary categories: 
        system vulnerabilities and human vulnerabilities. System vulnerabilities refers to technical aspects or flaws of 
        the system that the attacker is attempting to compromise that can be manipulated in order to perform an attack. 
        Human vulnerabilities are the ways in which people can be deceived or manipulated into revealing their own private 
        information. Phishing attacks generally take advantage of human vulnerabilities as opposed to system vulnerabilities, 
        though both can play a part in how a phishing attack is executed. The following section will discuss specifics of 
        the vulnerabilities that make phishing attacks possible, as well as the approaches that attackers use to manipulate 
        them. </p>

        <p>A great number of phishing attacks depend entirely on the victim lacking knowledge about how computers or the 
        internet work. For instance, an attacker may send a potential victim an email claiming to be from Microsoft notifying 
        them that their machine has a virus, and requests payment in order to fix the issue. Though many people in the modern 
        day recognize that this is not a way that Microsoft or any other legitimate software or hardware provider would contact 
        you about such an issue, those who have less experience with technology may not find the distinctions between what is 
        real and what is fraudulent to be obvious, and may become a victim of the attack. </p>

        <h3 id="Trust and Care for Friends and Family Members">Trust and Care for Friends and Family Members</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, a phishing attack may attempt to make use of a potential victim’s care for their friends or family members 
        to encourage them to interact with a fraudulent email or other message. For instance, an attacker might compose a fraudulent 
        email claiming or appearing to be from the potential victim’s nephew, cousin, or other extended family member, asking for 
        money for some kind of urgent purpose, such as paying bail. These attacks are predicated on the notion that someone will be 
        much more receptive to requests for money or information if they think that they are talking to someone they know. </p>
