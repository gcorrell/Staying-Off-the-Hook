        <p>To understand how to avoid phishing attacks, it can be helpful to understand exactly how these attacks work. 
        This section will provide a brief overview of the structure of a phishing attack. Phishing attacks are composed of three
        primary components: a <a href="Terms.html#Medium">medium</a>, a <a href="Terms.html#Vector">vector</a>, and a <a href="Terms.html#TechnicalApproach">technical approach</a>. An attack’s medium is the platform on which a phishing
        attack will be delivered. Examples of significant mediums used by phishing attacks are the Internet, SMS, and the phone
        calls. An attack’s vector is the channel of its medium that it uses. For instance, an attack based on the medium of the 
        Internet could use email or social media sites as its channel. Finally, an attack’s technical approach is the specific 
        technique used by the attacker to carry out the attack. For instance, the attacker may target specific browser vulnerabilities, 
        or make use of <a href="Terms.html#SocialEngineering">social engineering</a> techniques. Multiple technical approaches might be used in combination to carry out a single 
        attack.</p>

        <p>Though phishing attacks are often thought of as being exclusively conducted over email, the attack methodologies have 
        evolved over the years and adapted to a variety of mediums, vectors, and technical approaches. The following section 
        describes how these attacks are carried out in each of these mediums and the common vectors that said attacks will take. 
        Countermeasures (steps that can be taken to avoid phishing attacks) for attacks from each medium can be found <a href="Countermeasures.html">here</a>, 
        and elaboration on some commonly used technical approaches can be found <a href="Vulnerabilities.html">here</a>.</p>

        <h2 id ="Internet">Internet</h2>

        <h3 id ="Email">Email</h3>

        <p>When you think of a phishing attack, it's likely that the first concept that comes to mind is that of a fraudulent email.
        Email phishing has existed for significantly longer than many other phishing vectors, and has become one of the 
        most well-known types of online scams. According to a review of common phishing approaches by Kang Leng Chiew, Furkan Alaca, 
        and Sonia Chiasson in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, the standard structure of an email-based phishing
        attack involves the attacker creating an email to send to the target with two primary objectives. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Chiew, 2018</a>) The first is that the 
        email is intended to convince its receiver that it is from a legitimate corporation or trusted individual. The second is that 
        the email aims to coerce the receiver into performing a certain task, which can range from clicking a link that leads to a 
        malicious website to directly sending money to a fraudulent bank account. <p>

        </div>

        <h3 id ="Social Media">Social Media</h3>

        <p>Another, perhaps more relevant Internet-based vector that can be used by modern phishing attacks is social networking 
        sites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Part of what makes these sites potential assets for attackers is the large 
        amount of personal information that these sites store about their users. Abdul Ali discusses this issue in his paper, 
        “Social Engineering: Phishing Latest and Future Techniques”, noting that attackers use data-crawling platforms like 
        PromptCloud to extract specific information from social networking sites’ exceptionally large databases. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Ali</a>) 
        The information can then be used to impersonate or otherwise violate the privacy of their targets. For instance, a common 
        form of phishing attack on social media is for the attacker to either gain control of someone’s social media account or 
        create a new social media account designed to appear as if it belongs to someone the attacker's target knows. The attacker 
        will then message the target using this account in an attempt to manipulate the target’s trust in the person being 
        impersonated in order to convince them to reveal personal or private information.<p>

            <div class="center">
                <img src="Images/FakePaypalAccount.png" 
                    width="500"

        <p>The account featured in this image was impersonating a representative of PayPal by responding to Tweets from Paypal's customers requesting assistance with their accounts. The fraudulent 
        accounts would reply with an apology and a link to a site that it claimed would help them solve their problem, but most likely either downloaded malware or led to a malicious site.</p>

        <h3 id ="Websites">Websites</h3>
        
        <p>A concept that is distinct from the manipulation of existing legitimate sites such as social networking sites is the 
        creation of malicious sites that are meant to impersonate legitimate sites. According to “A survey of phishing attacks: 
        Their types, vectors and technical approaches”, malicious sites will often be designed to appear as similar as possible 
        to legitimate login pages for sites that require credentials to log into accounts. <a href="Bibliography.html">(Chiew, 2018)</a> The malicious sites will prompt 
        users to enter their credentials, which will then be delivered to the attacker rather than validated by the legitimate 
        site as the user expected. Generally speaking, users tend to find this type of attack to be more difficult to detect 
        without use of a detection tool than attacks that use vectors such as email.</p>

        <h3 id ="Telltale Signs">Telltale Signs</h3>
        <p>Though online phishing attacks in the modern day can often be quite convincing, there are still several ways that fraudulent emails, posts, 
        and websites can typically be recognized. Below are just a few.</p>

        <h4 id ="Grammatical Errors">Grammatical Errors</h4>
        <p>Although it is not unheard of for legitimate companies to send messages or host websites with minor mistakes in them, it is significantly more common in phishing 
        attempts. Particularly, if there is a typo or other mistake in the company's name in either the entity's content or, in the case of an email or social media message, 
        the name or address of the sender, there may be cause for concern. 
        </p>

        <h4 id ="Asking for Money">Asking for Money</h4>
        <p>If a message or site directly asks you to send money to a particular account or through a particular platform, it is always wise to exercise caution. 
        Consider if the presented situation really requires payment or the submission of financial information like credit card numbers. Generally, legitimate companies 
        will not ask for payment without being clear about what the payment is for.
        </p>

        <h4 id ="Suspicious Names and Domains">Suspicious Names and Domains</h4>
        <p>For safety purposes, it is wise to get into the habit of consistently checking the name or email address of the sender of a message before clicking a link or sending 
        any personal information in response to a message. In the case of websites, check the URL at the top of the browser window. For each of these described fields, check for typos 
        or suspicious wording. If a business-related email legitimately comes from a large corporation, the sender's email address will often include the name of the company as a domain. 
        If the sender has a typo in their name or is using an obscure or non-professional domain, you may have come across a phishing attempt.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id ="Short Messaging Service (SMS)">Short Messaging Service (SMS)</h2>

        <p>SMS-based phishing attacks occur when the attacker sends a message intended to somehow deceive the target through a 
        text message, generally through and to a mobile device. This specific type of attack is sometimes known as <a href="Terms.html#Smishing">smishing</a>. Smishing 
        attacks typically function in a similar way to Internet-based phishing attacks, although there are arguably less technical 
        vulnerabilities in the SMS system that such an attack can make use of. The following are some of the most common tactics used 
        by smishing attacks.</p>

        <h3 id ="Sending URLs">Sending URLs</h3>

        <p>Generally speaking, most smishing attacks come in a relatively simple form. The attacker will simply send out a text message 
        featuring a link that will either download malware or take the target to a malicious website. Because an unsolicited link will obviously raise suspicion, these messages will usually include 
        some sort of deceptive explanation. Common explanations include that links are for order confirmations, account activations, or user surveys. 
        If the attacker is lucky, the timing of their attack may line up with the behavior of the target and make the scam particularly believable. 
        For instance, if the attack includes a message to the target asking them to confirm their Amazon order not long after the target actually has 
        made an order from Amazon, the target will be more likely to click the link. For this reason, it is important to always check the name of a message's 
        sender before clicking on a link sent through a text, even if the link claims to be something relevant to you.  
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="Images/Smishing.jpg" 
            width="300" 
            height="450"
            alt="Smishing attempt">
        </div>

        <p>In the example above, the message claims to be from USPS, but the sender has been identified as a totally unrelated 
        address. As such, it can be reasonably assumed that this message is a smishing attempt.</p>

        <h3 id ="Telltale Signs">Telltale Signs</h3>
        <p>Given that SMS phishing attempts are text-based, just as online phishing attempts typically are, they share several telltale signs, particularly grammatical errors 
        in a messages content or sender name. However, there are some signs that are usually unique to SMS phishing attempts.
        </p>

        <h4 id ="Overly Friendly Wrong Numbers">Overly Friendly Wrong Numbers</h4>
        <p>SMS phishing attempts often disguise themselves as people who have contacted you by mistake when trying to message someone else. 
        In this case, the attacker will likely try to have a conversation with you after they discover their "mistake". If a wrong number seems 
        particularly interested in having a personal conversation, it is possible that they are attempting to engage in <a href="Terms.html#SocialEngineering">social engineering.</a>
        </p>

        <h4 id ="Unprompted Pictures">Unprompted Pictures</h4>
        <p>If an unknown number sends a picture of themselves without talking with you about it first, it is likely an attempt by an attacker to 
        convince you that they are someone who they are not. The technique is frequently employed to try to convince a target that the sender is a 
        conventionally attractive woman in order to coerce the target into keeping the conversation going.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id ="Voice">Voice</h2>
        
        <p>Phishing attacks that occur over a phone call are known as voice phishing (or <a href="Terms.html#Vhishing">vhishing</a>) attacks. Voice phishing attacks
        are carried out in the same way as other phishing attacks, but use phone calls rather than emails, ads, or instant messages to 
        reach their targets. In recent years, the development of voice phishing apps and other tools that are available to hackers 
        has raised the threat of this type of phishing attack considerably, as these tools provide several functionalities that 
        make it possible for attackers to create convincing fraudulent phone calls. </p>
        
        <h3 id ="Voice Phishing Apps">Voice Phishing Apps</h3>
        
        <p>One of the most common tools used by attackers in vhishing attacks are vhishing apps, which are fraudulent apps that will 
        allow the attacker to perform various functions on the target’s device. The first step an attacker takes in an attack 
        utilizing one of these apps is to get the target to download the app, usually by masquerading the app as some type of 
        financial application. According to a study by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (<a href="Bibliography.html">Kim et al, 2022</a>), 81% of a 
        sample of 1,017 voice phishing apps were pretending to be banking apps. After the target has downloaded the app, the attacker
        will try to get the target to make a call to the number of a legitimate financial institution, at which point the voice phishing 
        app can perform one of its true functions in order to complete the execution of the attack. A few of these apps’ common 
        capabilities are also described in the study by KAIST, including the following:</p>
        
        <h4 id ="Outgoing Call Redirection">I. Outgoing Call Redirection</h4>
        
        <p>Voice phishing apps will often have the ability to reroute outgoing calls from their home device. The attack’s target may 
        dial the number of a legitimate financial institution, such as their bank, but have their call rerouted to a number of the 
        attacker’s choosing without their knowledge. This allows the attacker to collect information from the target under the convincing 
        pretense that they are representing the bank or other financial institution. </p>
        
        <h4 id ="Call Screen Overlays">II. Call Screen Overlays</h4>
        
        <p>This function is quite similar to call redirection, though it does not actually reroute an outgoing call. Instead, a voice 
        phishing app may overlay the device’s authentic phone screen with a fake one, typically depicting a different phone number 
        than the one that the target is actually calling or being called by. One advantage that this provides attackers over call 
        redirection is that it can be used to falsify the identity of a call recipient or a caller, meaning it can be used for incoming 
        and outgoing calls. </p>
        
        <h4 id ="Fake Voice Recordings">III. Fake Voice Recordings</h4>
        
        <p>This is a feature of many voice phishing apps that works in conjunction with call redirection. Once a call from a target is 
        redirected, attackers may not want to risk having a personal conversation with the target to try to extract information, as this 
        can sometimes lead to suspicion and thus to the attack’s failure. Instead, attackers may redirect a call to a number that will 
        automatically play a recorded message that asks for the attacker’s desired information from the target, typically asserting that it 
        is necessary for them to receive the information in order to carry out some sort of financial function. </p>
        
        <h3 id ="Other Tools">Other Tools</h3>
        
        <p>It is also worth noting that many vhishing scams may not even require the target to download a fraudulent app to be successful. 
        For instance, another significant tool that can increase the probability of success for a vhishing attack is the use of <a href="Terms.html#Deepfake">deepfake</a> technology 
        to create an approximation of someone’s voice. By accessing voice samples stored by a social network service (SNS), an attacker can create a 
        deepfake synthetic voice that can sound relatively indistinct from someone’s real voice. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Kang et al, 2022</a>) The attacker can then use this synthetic 
        voice to make a phone call to a target that will seem to be from a friend or family member.</p>

        <h3 id ="Telltale Signs">Telltale Signs</h3>
        <p>Detecting voice-base phishing attempts can be quite difficult, particularly when implements such as deepfaked voices are used to 
        make the attacks convincing. However, there is a particular aspect of a phone call that can help you to spot fakes.
        </p>

        <h4 id ="Uncharacteristic Behavior">Uncharacteristic Behavior</h4>
        <p>In the case of vhishing attacks that directly call the target to somehow request money, there are some common 
        stories used that should generally be regarded with suspicion. One of these stories involves a caller asserting that they are a member of the target's 
        family (usually through an extended relation, such as the target's cousin or grandchild) and claiming that they got into trouble on a trip to another country 
        and landed in jail. The caller will request money from the target to pay their bail. Another common story is a caller to a store or other business claiming to 
        be the CEO or other high-level executive. The caller will order the employee who answers the phone to convert company funds into some sort of non-traceable form 
        of payment (often gift cards) and transfer them to a particular account. In each of these cases, as well as many others, you can avoid falling victim to the attack by taking a moment 
        to consider whether what the caller is saying lines up with what you know about who they are claiming to be. Most people's relatives are quite unlikely to find themselves 
        in a foreign prison, and there has likely never been a single instance of a legitimate corporate CEO asking a low-level employee to convert company funds into gift cards. 
        By taking the time to critically analyze the likelihood of a situation that a caller describes, you can often determine whether or not a caller truly is who they claim to be.
