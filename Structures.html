        <p>To understand how to avoid phishing attacks, it can be helpful to understand exactly how these attacks work. 
This section will provide a brief overview of the structure of a phishing attack. Phishing attacks are composed of three
primary components: a medium, a vector, and a technical approach. An attack’s medium is the platform on which a phishing
attack will be delivered. Examples of significant mediums used by phishing attacks are the Internet, SMS, and the phone
calls. An attack’s vector is the channel of its medium that it uses. For instance, an attack based on the medium of the 
Internet could use email or social media sites as its channel. Finally, an attack’s technical approach 

Though phishing attacks are often thought of as being exclusively conducted over email, the attack methodologies have 
evolved over the years and adapted to a variety of mediums, vectors, and technical approaches. The following section 
describes how these attacks are carried out in each of these mediums and the common vectors that said attacks will take. 
Countermeasures (steps that can be taken to avoid phishing attacks) for attacks from each medium can be found here 
(link to countermeasures page), and elaboration on some commonly used technical approaches can be found <a href="Structures.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>When you think of a phishing attack, it's likely that the first concept that comes to mind is that of a fraudulent email.
Email phishing has existed for significantly longer than many other phishing vectors, and has become one of the 
most well-known types of online scams. According to a review of common phishing approaches by Kang Leng Chiew, Furkan Alaca,
 and Sonia Chiasson in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, the standard structure of an email-based phishing
attack involves the attacker creating an email to send with the target with two primary objectives. The first is that the 
email is intended to convince its receiver that it is from a legitimate corporation or trusted individual. The second is that 
the email aims to coerce the receiver into performing a certain task, which can range from clicking a link that leads to a 
malicious website to directly sending money to a fraudulent bank account. <p>
