        <p>To understand how to avoid phishing attacks, it can be helpful to understand exactly how these attacks work. 
This section will provide a brief overview of the structure of a phishing attack. Phishing attacks are composed of three
primary components: a medium, a vector, and a technical approach. An attack’s medium is the platform on which a phishing
attack will be delivered. Examples of significant mediums used by phishing attacks are the Internet, SMS, and the phone
calls. An attack’s vector is the channel of its medium that it uses. For instance, an attack based on the medium of the 
Internet could use email or social media sites as its channel. Finally, an attack’s technical approach 

Though phishing attacks are often thought of as being exclusively conducted over email, the attack methodologies have 
evolved over the years and adapted to a variety of mediums, vectors, and technical approaches. The following section 
describes how these attacks are carried out in each of these mediums and the common vectors that said attacks will take. 
Countermeasures (steps that can be taken to avoid phishing attacks) for attacks from each medium can be found here 
(link to countermeasures page), and elaboration on some commonly used technical approaches can be found <a href="Structures.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id ="Email">Email</h3>

<p>When you think of a phishing attack, it's likely that the first concept that comes to mind is that of a fraudulent email.
Email phishing has existed for significantly longer than many other phishing vectors, and has become one of the 
most well-known types of online scams. According to a review of common phishing approaches by Kang Leng Chiew, Furkan Alaca,
 and Sonia Chiasson in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, the standard structure of an email-based phishing
attack involves the attacker creating an email to send with the target with two primary objectives. The first is that the 
email is intended to convince its receiver that it is from a legitimate corporation or trusted individual. The second is that 
the email aims to coerce the receiver into performing a certain task, which can range from clicking a link that leads to a 
malicious website to directly sending money to a fraudulent bank account. <p>

<h3 id ="Social Media">Social Media</h3>

<p>Another, perhaps more relevant Internet-based vector that can be used by modern phishing attacks is social networking 
sites such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Part of what makes these sites potential assets for attackers is the large 
amount of personal information that these sites store about their users. Abdul Ali discusses this issue in his paper, 
“Social Engineering: Phishing Latest and Future Techniques”, noting that attackers use data-crawling platforms like 
PromptCloud to extract specific information from social networking sites’ large exceptionally large databases (Abdul). 
The information can then be used to impersonate or otherwise violate the privacy of their targets. For instance, a common 
form of phishing attack on social media is for the attacker to either gain control of someone’s social media account or 
create a new social media account designed to appear as if it belongs to someone the attacker's target knows. The attacker 
will then message the target using this account in an attempt to manipulate the target’s trust in the person being 
impersonated in order to convince them to reveal personal or private information.<p>

<h3 id ="Websites">Webstites</h3>

<p>A concept that is distinct from the manipulation of existing legitimate sites such as social networking sites is the 
    creation of malicious sites that are meant to impersonate legitimate sites. According to “A survey of phishing attacks: 
    Their types, vectors and technical approaches”, malicious sites will often be designed to appear as similar as possible 
    to legitimate login pages for sites that require credentials to log into accounts. The malicious sites will prompt 
    users to enter their credentials, which will then be delivered to the attacker rather than validated by the legitimate 
    site as the user expected. Generally speaking, users tend to find this type of attack to be more difficult to detect 
    without use of a detection tool than attacks that use vectors such as email.</p>
