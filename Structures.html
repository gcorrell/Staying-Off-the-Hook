        <p>To understand how to avoid phishing attacks, it can be helpful to understand exactly how these attacks work. 
This section will provide a brief overview of the structure of a phishing attack. Phishing attacks are composed of three
primary components: a medium, a vector, and a technical approach. An attack’s medium is the platform on which a phishing
attack will be delivered. Examples of significant mediums used by phishing attacks are the Internet, SMS, and the phone
calls. An attack’s vector is the channel of its medium that it uses. For instance, an attack based on the medium of the 
Internet could use email or social media sites as its channel. Finally, an attack’s technical approach 

Though phishing attacks are often thought of as being exclusively conducted over email, the attack methodologies have 
evolved over the years and adapted to a variety of mediums, vectors, and technical approaches. The following section 
describes how these attacks are carried out in each of these mediums and the common vectors that said attacks will take. 
Countermeasures (steps that can be taken to avoid phishing attacks) for attacks from each medium can be found here 
(link to countermeasures page), and elaboration on some commonly used technical approaches can be found here: </p>
