        <p>When discussing any sort of cybersecurity threat, you're likely to run into some technical 
        vocabulary. This section can be used as a reference for the meaning of any unknown terms used
        on this site.</p>

        <h4 id="ChromeArea">Chrome Area</h4>
        <p>This is the part of a web browser that appears above the content of the web page being displayed. It includes 
        the URL of the current site, the status bar, the tool bar, and other important components of the browser.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Client-side">Client-side</h4>
        <p>Anything that occurs on the client side of a system is happening at the end-users device. If you are 
        viewing a webpage from your laptop, the processes occuring on your laptop are occurring on the client side.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Countermeasure">Countermeasure</h4>
        <p>A countermeasure can be any action taken to combat the threat of a cyberattack. They can range from exhibiting 
        cautious behaviors to the use of cybersecurity protection software.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Deepfake">Deepfake</h4>
        <p>A digitally altered piece of media (video, audio, etc.) that is made to seem as though it features
        a paticular person.
        </p>

        <h4 id="DNS">DNS</h4>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is what transforms domain names, which are readable for people, to IP addresses, which can be read by machines.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Encryption">Encryption</h4>
        <p>Encrpytion is the process of scrambling data so that it is unreadable without access to a particular cryptographic key. 
        The key can be used to return encrypted data back into a readable form called plain text. Encryption is an extremely important part 
        of information security, particularly when information is being sent from one party to another, as it ensures that 
        only the intended recipient can read the data.
        </p>

        <h4 id="F-score">F-score</h4>
        <p>In statistics, an algorithm's F-score measures its predictive ability. The score itself is on a 
        scale from 0 to 1, but may sometimes be expressed as a percentage.
        </p>

        <h4 id="HTMLContent">HTML Content</h4>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard language used for creating the visual design of webpages 
        that are intended to be displayed by web browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. A page's HTML content 
        simply refers to the HTML source of a website. HTML is commonly paired with style sheet languages like CSS in 
        order to customize a page's fonts, colors, spacing, and other elements of visual design.
        </p>

        <h4 id="InputValidation">Input Validation</h4>
        <p>In the context of web development, a page's input validation ensures that any text box or other input form that 
        accepts input from a user will only accept the appropriate types of characters. For instance, a login page for a site 
        might only accept input that includes alphanumeric characters.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Malware">Malware</h4>
        <p>Malware is somewhat of a catch-all term that refers generally to software that is designed to harm or gain 
        unauthorized access to its target system.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Medium">Medium</h4>
        <p>An attack’s medium is the platform on which a phishing attack will be delivered. Examples of 
        significant mediums used by phishing attacks are the Internet, SMS, and the phone calls.
        </p>

        <h4 id="NetworkTraffic">Network Traffic</h4>
        <p>The flow of data packets that are being transferred over a given network.
        </p>

        <h4 id="PhishingAttack">Phishing Attack</h4>
        <p>A broad term referring to an attack that aims to trick its target into revealing sensitive 
        or private information to the attacker.
        </p>

        <h4 id="SecurityIndicators">Security Indicators</h4>
        <p>In the context of browser security, security indicators refers to visible symbols or signs that indicate
        whether certain safety protocols are followed by the site the browser is currently displaying.
        </p>

        <h4 id="SessionID">Session ID</h4>
        <p>A piece of data that is specific to and is used to identify a user's particular connection to a server.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Smishing">Smishing</h4>
        <p>This refers to a phishing attack that utilizes mobile text messaging, also known as SMS.
        </p>

        <h4 id="SocialEngineering">Social Engineering</h4>
        <p>Social engineering involves trying to deceive or manipulate a user into revealing their own private information 
        without the need to exploit a technical vulnerability, though it can often be used in conjunction with other technical 
        approaches. If an attacker calls a target pretending to be a Microsoft support representative in order to get them to 
        reveal their information, that would be considered social engineering.
        </p>

        <h4 id="TechnicalApproach">Technical Approach</h4>
        <p>An attack’s technical approach is the specific technique used by the attacker to carry out the attack.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Vector">Vector</h4>
