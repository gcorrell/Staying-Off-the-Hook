        <h1 id="Key Terms">Key Terms</h1>
        <p>When discussing any sort of cybersecurity threat, you're likely to run into some technical 
        vocabulary. This section can be used as a reference for the meaning of any unknown terms used
        on this site.</p>

        <h4 id="Client-side">Client-side</h4>
        <p>Anything that occurs on the client side of a system is happening at the end-users device. If you are 
        viewing a webpage from your laptop, the processes occuring on your laptop are occurring on the client side.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Deepfake">Deepfake</h4>
        <p>A digitally altered piece of media (video, audio, etc.) that is made to seem as though it features
        a paticular person.
        </p>

        <h4 id="F-score">F-score</h4>
        <p>In statistics, an algorithm's F-score measures its predictive ability. The score itself is on a 
        scale from 0 to 1, but may sometimes be expressed as a percentage.
        </p>

        <h4 id="HTMLContent">HTML Content</h4>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard language used for creating the visual design of webpages 
        that are intended to be displayed by web browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. A page's HTML content 
        simply refers to the HTML source of a website. HTML is commonly paired with style sheet languages like CSS in 
        order to customize a page's fonts, colors, spacing, and other elements of visual design.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Malware">Malware</h4>
        <p>Malware is somewhat of a catch-all term that refers generally to software that is designed to harm or gain 
        unauthorized access to its target system.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Medium">Medium</h4>
        <p>An attack’s medium is the platform on which a phishing attack will be delivered. Examples of 
        significant mediums used by phishing attacks are the Internet, SMS, and the phone calls.
        </p>

        <h4 id="SecurityIndicators">Security Indicators</h4>
        <p>In the context of browser security, security indicators refers to visible symbols or signs that indicate
        whether certain safety protocols are followed by the site the browser is currently displaying.
        </p>

        <h4 id="SocialEngineering">Social Engineering</h4>
        <p>Social engineering involves trying to deceive or manipulate a user into revealing their own private information 
        without the need to exploit a technical vulnerability, though it can often be used in conjunction with other technical 
        approaches. If an attacker calls a target pretending to be a Microsoft support representative in order to get them to 
        reveal their information, that would be considered social engineering.
        </p>

        <h4 id="TechnicalApproach">Technical Approach</h4>
        <p>An attack’s technical approach is the specific technique used by the attacker to carry out the attack.
        </p>

        <h4 id="Vector">Vector</h4>
        <p>An attack’s vector is the channel of its medium that it uses. For instance, an attack based on the medium of the 
        Internet could use email or social media sites as its channel.
        </p>
