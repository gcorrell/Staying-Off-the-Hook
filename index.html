        <p><a href="Terms.html#PhishingAttack">Phishing attacks</a> are one of the most common ways for attackers to try to gain access to a personâ€™s 
        private or personal information. While phishing has traditionally been propagated through fraudulent emails 
        or other online messages, phishing in the modern day has evolved to take new forms that are far less 
        familiar, and therefore less identifiable, to the general public. This site contains all the information 
        you need to ensure that you can properly spot and react to a variety of types of modern phishing scams. </p>

        <p>This project was originally conceived with the goal of creating an accessible educational resource in mind,
        particularly for those who are just entering adulthood and have yet to have much significant experience with 
        phishing scams. The content featured on this site is a synthesis and analysis of research from a variety of scholarly sources, each of which can be found on the 
        <a href="Bibliography.html">bibliography page</a>. The origin of particular facts, statistics, and concepts are also specifically 
        noted within the content itself. Unlike other research papers, the results of the research for this project have been compiled onto an easy-to-navigate website
        in order to increase readability and accessibility. A few additional steps have also been taken to further increase approachability. 
        The more technical vocabulary featured in the site's content includes links to a reference page for <a href="Terms.html">key terms</a> in order to ensure that the site remains easy to read and understand 
        for anyone looking to familiarize themselves with the information needed to stay safe online in the modern world. The content has also been written 
        with the intent to keep even the more complex concepts discussed as simple as possible in order to make the site a useful resource to anyone, regardless of 
        their technological experience.
        </p>
        <p>The site is designed to be able to be read from any page without needing to read the others first, though the <a href="Structures.html">structures page</a> is a good place to start if you would like to
        learn more about what phishing is and how it happens.</p>
