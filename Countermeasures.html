        <p>For most people, perhaps the most important thing to know about the various types of 
        phishing scams is how to avoid falling victim to them. This section discusses practices that you 
        can put into place to avoid and counteract phishing attacks, as well as some tools that can help 
        with this process.</p>

        <h2 id="Awareness">Awareness</h2>
        <p>One of the most straightforward strategies for avoiding phishing attacks is to simply be aware 
        of such attacks and the typical forms that they can take. As such, reading informational resources 
        like this site is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself against phishing attacks. Unfortunately, 
        however, modern phishing attacks can be a bit difficult to recognize even when you are looking for 
        them. A study by Mohamed Alsharnouby for the International Journal of Human-Computer studies indicated 
        that users only correctly identified 53% of a set of phishing websites as such when presented with a 
        large set of both fraudulent and non-fraudulent sites. (Alsharnouby) Interestingly, the study also 
        found that each user’s general technological proficiency had little correlation with their ability 
        to identify phishing websites (though technical knowledge of the web environment is known to increase 
        a person’s resistance to phishing). Instead, the factor with the biggest influence on a user’s ability 
        to detect phishing websites was whether the user pays attention to their browser’s built-in security 
        indicators.  Two of the most common and significant security indicators included in every major 
        browser is the SSL lock and the https portion of a website URL. An SSL lock is a small lock icon that 
        appears to the left of a website’s URL.</p>

        <p>If you see this symbol, it indicates that the connection between your browser and the site’s server
        is encrypted, which helps to preserve your privacy and information security. Encryption may also be 
        indicated by the URL’s inclusion of “https” at its beginning rather than just “http”. </p>

        <p>Keeping these sorts of indicators in mind can help you to identify whether or not the website 
        that you’re currently viewing is legitimate and help you to determine whether or not you should trust a site 
        with your information.</p>
