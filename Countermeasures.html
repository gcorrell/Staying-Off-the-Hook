        <p>For most people, perhaps the most important thing to know about the various types of 
        phishing scams is how to avoid falling victim to them. This section discusses practices that you 
        can put into place to avoid and counteract phishing attacks, as well as some tools that can help 
        with this process.</p>

        <h2 id="Awareness">Awareness</h2>
        <p>One of the most straightforward strategies for avoiding phishing attacks is to simply be aware 
        of such attacks and the typical forms that they can take. As such, reading informational resources 
        like this site is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself against phishing attacks. Unfortunately, 
        however, modern phishing attacks can be a bit difficult to recognize even when you are looking for 
        them. A study by Mohamed Alsharnouby for the International Journal of Human-Computer studies indicated 
        that users only correctly identified 53% of a set of phishing websites as such when presented with a 
        large set of both fraudulent and non-fraudulent sites. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Alsharnouby, 2015</a>) Interestingly, the study also 
        found that each user’s general technological proficiency had little correlation with their ability 
        to identify phishing websites (though technical knowledge of the web environment is known to increase 
        a person’s resistance to phishing). Instead, the factor with the biggest influence on a user’s ability 
        to detect phishing websites was whether the user pays attention to their browser’s built-in <a href="Terms.html#SecurityIndicators">security indicators</a>.  
        Two of the most common and significant security indicators included in every major 
        browser is the SSL lock and the https portion of a website URL. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Kelley, 2022</a>) An SSL lock is a small lock icon that 
        appears to the left of a website’s URL.</p> 

        <div class="center">
            <img src="Images/Lock.PNG" 
            width="600" 
            height="400"
            alt="SSL Lock">
        </div>

        <p>If you see this symbol, it indicates that the connection between your browser and the site’s server
        is <a href="Terms.html#Encryption">encrypted</a>, which helps to preserve your privacy and information security. Encryption may also be 
        indicated by the URL’s inclusion of “https” at its beginning rather than just “http”. </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="Images/HTTPS.PNG" 
            width="600" 
            height="400"
            alt="HTTPS">
        </div>
        
        <p>Keeping these sorts of indicators in mind can help you to identify whether or not the website 
        that you’re currently viewing is legitimate and help you to determine whether or not you should trust a site 
        with your information.</p>

        <h2 id="Detection Tools">Detection Tools</h2>

        <p>If you feel that you are a particularly vulnerable target to phishing scams, you may want to 
        download some phishing attack prevention software, which can often identify signs that an email 
        or other message is fraudulent that a human may not. While this type of application does exist, 
        it is important to emphasize that you should exercise caution when downloading anything from 
        the internet, particularly software that advertises itself as cybersecurity protection software, 
        as this is a common way for attackers to disguise <a href="Terms.html#Malware">malware</a>. Below are some examples of existing 
        or forthcoming anti-phishing software.</p>

        <h3 id="Direct Webpage Content Analysis">Direct Webpage Content Analysis</h3>

        <p>One type of software framework that can be used to detect phishing attacks is a framework 
        that can be integrated into your browser to directly analyze the legitimacy of the content of 
        each webpage that the browser visits, making it possible for the system to notify you of potential 
        scams or malicious content in real time when browsing the web. Such a system was introduced at the 
        5th International Conference on Network and System Security in 2011 by Sophie Gastellier-Provost. 
        This system had two primary functions. First, the system detects <a href="Terms.html#DNS">DNS</a> (domain name system) 
        compromises at the client-side, delivering the user a pop-up warning message indicating that the 
        currently displayed site may be illegitimate. Finding said DNS compromises is achieved by doing IP 
        address checks for web domains that the user visits. Second, the system presents an additional 
        security indicator in the chrome area (the area surrounding the URL) of the browser that displays 
        a trust level that the system has in the current site. This trust level is determined by performing 
        a comparison between the <a href="Terms.html#HTMLContent">HTML Content</a> of the webpage that the browser is currently displaying and 
        that of a reference webpage that is known to be legitimate. The system achieved a 95% success rate 
        for identifying potentially fraudulent login webpages, suggesting that this type of detection tool 
        could be a reasonably reliable form of protection from webpage-based phishing attacks. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Gastellier-Prevost, 2011</a>)</p>

        <h3 id="Machine Learning and Classifiers">Machine Learning and Classifiers</h3>

        <p>Another approach to browser-based website phishing detection is to use machine learning models 
        to develop classifiers that can determine whether or not a site is a phishing site. A system 
        developed by Samuel Marchal and his team called Off-the-Hook. As opposed to comparing the HTML 
        content of the website in question directly to a reference webpage, Off-the-Hook uses existing 
        datasets to extract a feature set that can be used to characterize phishing sites, then the 
        system then simply determines whether or not the existing site fits this characterization in 
        order to classify it. This approach circumvents the limitation of requiring an appropriate 
        reference webpage to compare the current webpage to. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Marchal, 2017</a>)</p>

        <h3 id="Deep Voice Detection">Machine Learning and Classifiers</h3>

        <p>As deepfake technology has continued to increase the capabilities of attackers to synthesize 
        approximations of real peoples’ voices, the need has arisen for software that can successfully 
        distinguish these faked voices from real voices. Fortunately, recent years have seen the 
        development of such tools. For instance, in 2022, Yeajun Kang and his team of researchers unveiled 
        the DeepDetection system, which is capable of detecting deepfaked voices with an <a href="Terms.html#F-score">F-score</a> 
        (a measure of predictive accuracy) of 100%. The system functions by extracting meaningful features 
        of the inputted voice data, then comparing the extracted feature vector to that of a deepfaked 
        voice in order to classify the input voice data as either a real user’s or a fake. (<a href="Bibliography.html">Kang et al, 2022</a>) 
        The system would be able to be made available to users via their mobile devices, making it accessible 
        to almost anyone.</p>
